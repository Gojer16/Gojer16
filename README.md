# Orlando Ascanio

> Grow. Build. Refine. Repeat.

I design and build thoughtful software systems that solve real problems, scale responsibly, and feel clean from the inside out.

---

I’m interested in the intersection of:

- Software engineering.
- Applied AI.
- Data and decision systems.  
- Human-centered tools.

If it improves how people think, build, or operate, I want to work on it.
